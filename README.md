# Bicep-Curl-Counter
A Python application that uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect and count bicep curls from a video file in real-time. The system tracks human poses, calculates the elbow joint angle, counts repetitions, and displays the results on the video feed with a status box showing reps and arm stage (up/down). It also logs workout data to a file.
